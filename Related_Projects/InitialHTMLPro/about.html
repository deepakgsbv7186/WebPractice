						Food is the most essential requirement for sustenance of human life. Even if a human being does not have shelter over their head or clothes over their body, they would still survive if they get wholesome nutrition. That is why all over human history, we have been motivated to search and seek food. Throughout history food has acted as a catalyst for societal transformation, societal organization, competition, development, conflict and expansion.

From the earliest cavemen who survived on hunting to the more advanced civilizations which used agriculture, food transformed human life by giving it structure. It paved way to the path of the modern civilization we know. We moved from caves to fertile lands near water. While adopting staple crops humans increased their chances of survival several fold. These genetic engineers laid down the tools which would shape the emergence of civilization as we know it. It resulted in families and social structure which emerged into the complex societies.

The political, economic, religious structure was based solely on food production and distribution. The development of irrigation and food surplus storage lead to political centralization. Food became a medium of payment and taxation. Feasts became a means to demonstrate status and garner influence. Throughout the ancient history before the invention of money, food was wealth and control of food was power.

Food also formed the basis of the earliest forms of religions and religious practices. The earliest Pagan and Hindu gods were directly responsible for the production of food, like the Earth, the river, the rain. Most religious practices and events were centered on the timings of sowing or harvesting. In later religious practices the choicest cut of the meats were offered to the Gods, the first harvest was dedicated to the divine.
